# Replace the use of System.Threading.ThreadPool with SmartThreadPool.

# Put descriptions on all your public methods and properties.

3) NOT STARTED
Build xml documentation (Visual Studio can do this automatically).

# 4) DONE
# Why are some of my runs hanging? It looks weird... like maybe I have 
# some threads accessing the same shit.

5) NOT STARTED
It may be nice to enhance the mutation types. Currently I'm using the 
roulette style parent selection method. It seems to depend on the 
absolute value of the fitnesses... which is not cool. Also might be
nice to have a mutate-up and mutate-down option, but since values 
aren't discrete I'm not sure how to do it best.

# 6) NOT STARTED
# Enhance termination conditions.
# At the moment it runs to a set number of generations. But I would like
# to be able to control it better. Maybe use a pest-style convergence 
# criteria where you require a certain level of stability over a certain
# number of consecutive generations. An optional time-out would also be 
# good.
#
# 7) NOT STARTED
# Add another couple of constructors to GA.cs. Choose a couple that 
# you think might be handy, and make sure the parameters adopt reasonable
# default values.
#
# 8) NOT STARTED
# The GA should offer a callback which is triggered at the end 
# of each generation. The callback should return information including
# - a timestamp
# - the number of runs completed
# - the number of generations completed
# - the best fitness so far
